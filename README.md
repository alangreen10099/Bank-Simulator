This is a Bank Simulator.  It is used for scambaiting Tech Support, Amazon, Norton, or Paypal scammers.  When the scammers ask a scambaiter to go to their bank, instead of going to the banks website, tell them that you have a special connection to your bank and that you can get your balance sheet through that special connection.  It will leave the scammer baffled as to how to change the numbers.

A second program call Bitcoin_Wallet.  This can be used to make the scammer beleive that there are bitcoins in your wallet.
